# Literary Trivia: It's Lit! 

Lit Trivia is a ten-question self-scoring trivia game that tests user's knowledge of literary, publishing, and bookselling history. 

# List of features

This project is pretty close to its original rendering: a ten-question, self-scoring game with clean, simple design; photos for options; and links to enable users to tap into a greater literary community. 

This project was built using a simple HTML wireframe, the JavaScript Dom, and CSS Styling. Areas for improvement include manipulating the dom so that each image-option's "alt" text fills in with the title; fixing the home button so that it restarts the game; and making this game responsive.

This developer would like future iterations of this game to include different categories of literary trivia (i.e. "Science Fiction," "Bestsellers," etc.)
